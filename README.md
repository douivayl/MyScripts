Welcome to the MyScripts repository. This repo contains simple scripts to help with day-to-day infrastructure management tasks mainly centered on storage. The repository will be organized into directories based on the technology or solution the scripts are designed for. To simplify the repo maintenance all the scripts will have inline documentation or comment-based help you can reference.

Currently, the repo contains PowerShell scripts that use SolidFire API to complete different tasks which may not be easy to perform from Element UI, or when Element UI is unavailable. More directories will be added for other technologies and solutions as needed.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or suggest improvements. No fancy stuff here â€” just straightforward scripts for getting the job done.
